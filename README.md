Things to Do:
 - Jump between platforms, avoiding enemies and spikes in order to not lose HP
 - Float on the updraft above the blue box on the ground. It lifts you higher when you jump if you are too heavy to float.
 - Try reaching the high platform in one jump. Hint: leap + updraft
 - Try moving in each of the different forms, experimenting with traversal
 - Die on enemies and spikes when you run out of HP!
