This is a vertical slice of an arena-oriented action platformer with a stat-based progression system.

How to install and execute game: 
 - Open executable file
 - Start game via menu

How to play / Controls: 
 - Quit the game by tapping Q
 - Move side to side with the left and right arrow keys
 - Jump with Spacebar (hold for higher jump)
 - Attack enemies in front of you by tapping Z (Note: no animation, there is an attack cooldown, see Console Log for alerts)
	- direct attacks up by holding the up arrow key
	- direct attacks down during a jump by holding the down arrow key
 - Take on different forms to move through the world:
	- Tap 1: PlainForm, allows you to attack and use abilities
	- Tap 2: FlatForm, floats on thermals well but leap is disabled
	- Tap 3: BallForm, rolls fast and bounces (collision artefacts)
 - Use special abilities to traverse obstacles
	- X: leap higher next time you jump (color changes when active)
	- C: dash in the direction you're moving (there is a cooldown of a few seconds)
 - Upgrade stats after each level to increase your character's damage, speed, health, and abilities

Things to Do:
 - Jump between platforms, avoiding enemies and spikes in order to not lose HP
 - Float on the updraft above the blue box on the ground. It lifts you higher when you jump if you are too heavy to float.
 - Try reaching the high platform in one jump. Hint: leap + updraft
 - Try moving in each of the different forms, experimenting with traversal
 - Die on enemies and spikes when you run out of HP!
